Assignment02 Design Doc

The design brief of the project specified for assignment required us to create a basic implementation of the board game focus utilising stacks.
I divided my project into four distinct modules along with the associated headers.
My first file was main.c where execution would begin and to where execution would return at the end of every turn.
I then added and finished the implementation of the file game_init.c provided to us as part of the tutorial.
This contained all the relevant struct definitions in its header and the functions required to initialise the game.
I also included input_output.c which provided the functionality required to print the board to the console.
As the project progressed, I would make several alterations to how the board was displayed.
The final module I worked on was turn.c which contained all the functionality required for a player to take a turn.
This module contains a wide variety of functions which allowed a player to perform a variety of potential moves dependant on their position and the current state of the game.
